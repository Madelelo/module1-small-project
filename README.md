# Module1 small project #
This projects is intended to be the "Hello, World!" of [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)
on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

## Task 0: Install Hexo ##
If you haven't already you will need to install Hexo. Hexo has some [good
documentation](https://hexo.io/docs/index.html) on how to do this.

## Task 1: Run a basic website locally ##
Now that you have Hexo installed, use it to build a basic website and run it
locally. Our only requirements at the moment are that your site should have a
"page" and a "post". We will make it a bit more complicated  in the next step.
Digital Ocean has a [nice tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-blog-with-hexo-on-ubuntu-14-04)
on how you might do this (the relevant stuff stops after step 4).

## Task 2: Make it fancy ##
Add a [Hexo theme](https://hexo.io/themes/) to your website. You __don't__ need
to write one yourself, just pick one of the many available.

## Task 3: Make it __super__ fancy ##
Add a YouTube video using
[Hexo's tag plugins](https://hexo.io/docs/tag-plugins.html#YouTube).

## Task 4: deploy ##
Now that we have something that works locally, let's put it on Heroku.
You will need to setup a config file to get this working. Fortunately [Hexo has
documentation on exactly how to deploy to Heroku](https://hexo.io/docs/deployment.html).

## Submitting ##
- Make sure your code is up-to-date on GitHub.
- Add your Heroku website url to your repo's description.
